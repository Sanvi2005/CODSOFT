# Excited to share my CodSoft internship projects!

This repository is dedicated to the projects I’ve worked on during my internship at **CodSoft**. My focus is on enhancing my Python programming skills through diverse, hands-on projects. Each one tackles different aspects of Python development, offering me a comprehensive learning experience.

## Projects Overview

### 1. To-Do List Application
A simple yet powerful to-do list tool that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The app helps manage daily activities by categorizing tasks, setting due dates, and prioritizing tasks based on importance. Key features include:
- Task categorization
- Due dates and priority levels
- Completion and overdue tracking

### 2. Calculator with Arithmetic Operations
This project reinforces core Python concepts by building a basic calculator. It performs essential arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Focus areas include:
- Clean code practices
- A user-friendly command-line interface

### 3. Password Generator Application
In today’s digital age, security is crucial. This password generator creates strong, random passwords based on user specifications, including length and complexity. It ensures robust protection for users' accounts by offering:
- Customizable password length
- Character complexity options (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

### 4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A fun and interactive game where users play rock-paper-scissors against the computer. This project showcases the use of conditional logic and random number generation to simulate an engaging gameplay experience.

### 5. Contact Information Application
An application designed to store and manage contact details efficiently. Users can add, search, update, and delete contacts. This project focuses on:
- Data storage and retrieval using JSON
- Search and sort functionality
- A clean, intuitive interface

## 
Through these projects, I’m deepening my understanding of Python programming and gaining practical experience in software design. Each project is a stepping stone towards mastering different aspects of coding. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to grow during my CodSoft internship!

Thank you for visiting my repository. Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback!
